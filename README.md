# big_mart_sales_prediction
This repository contains the notebook for predicting the sales of "Big Mart" using neural networks.

Amount of sales from the mart is predicted based on the data about Items like weight, visibility, fat content, type, MRP and about the store like its' size, establishment year,  location type and ID using deep neural networks.
EDA and Feature engineering.
Neural network is created using Keras. There are two hidden layers (20, 10 neurons) and the output layer contains only one neuron. 
Activation functions : ReLu for hidden layers and Linear for output layer.
Loss Function; root mean squared error. Optimizer: Adam
